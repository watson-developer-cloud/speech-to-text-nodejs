# Speech to Text Browser Application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/speech-to-text-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/speech-to-text-nodejs)

  The [Speech to Text][service_url] service uses IBM's speech recognition capabilities to convert speech in multiple languages into text. The transcription of incoming audio is continuously sent back to the client with minimal delay, and it is corrected as more speech is heard. The service is accessed via a WebSocket interface; a REST HTTP interface is also available;

Node.js is also used to provide the browser client's authentication token.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-to-text-nodejs)

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - services:
    - speech-to-text-service-standard
    name: <application-name>
    command: node app.js
    path: .
    memory: 512M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

6. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool.
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

7. Create the Speech to Text service in Bluemix.
  ```sh
  $ cf create-service speech_to_text standard speech-to-text-service-standard
  ```

8. Push it live!
  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally

  The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you will have to download and install them as part of the steps below.

1. Copy the credentials from your `speech-to-text-service-standard` service in Bluemix to `app.js`, you can see the credentials using:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "speech_to_text": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "speech-to-text",
        "name": "speech-to-text-service-standard",
        "plan": "standard"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`. Then you need to pass those values in app.js

    ```
    var config = {
      version: 'v1',
      url: 'https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api',
      username: '<username>',
      password: '<password>'  
    };
    ```

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

3. To install project dependencies, go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

5. Start the application:
    ```sh
    $ npm start
    ```

6. Go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```

For problems with recording audio, you can play back the audio you just recorded for debugging purposes.
To do that, add '?debug=true' (without the quotations) in the URL.

### Privacy Notice

This node sample web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other [Cloud Foundry] platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker][deploy_track_url] service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require('cf-deployment-tracker-client').track();` from the beginning of the `server.js` file at the root of this repo.
